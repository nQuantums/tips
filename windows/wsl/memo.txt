  <!-- On Unix systems, the most secure authentication mechanism is
  EXTERNAL, which uses credential-passing over Unix sockets.

  This authentication mechanism is not available on Windows,
  is not suitable for use with the tcp: or nonce-tcp: transports,
  and will not work on obscure flavours of Unix that do not have
  a supported credentials-passing mechanism. On those platforms/transports,
  comment out the <auth> element to allow fallback to DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1. -->
